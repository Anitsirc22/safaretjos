	'description':'The inhabitants of a city produce a constant flow of data. This data can be visualized and taken as a basis for observation and future decisions. The visualization of this info creates new knowledge about the city and is able to make the invisible visible (create an observatory). Active participation of citizens as well as passively collected data has helped to understand the neighbourhood from 7 dimensions./identify citizens perceptions and barriers in the neighbourhood/different dimensions in the neighbourhood that have question the actual urban plan. This project is focused on the neighborhood of Els Safaretjos in Santa Coloma de Gramenet (Barcelona). It is a territory within the framework of the Bes√≥s River, a metropolitan infrastructure that currently articulates the debate and the need to formulate proposals that come from the administrations as well as from citizens and the academy. At the same time, it is eccentric of its city Santa Coloma de Gramenet. The area is in a certain urban lack of definition. It has been envisaged as an AREE  (strategic residential area) and now it has come to a halt pending political decisions, both local and supra-local. The neighborhood of Els Safaretjos is part of District V, which extends over 65 Ha, in which 24,042 people live.',
